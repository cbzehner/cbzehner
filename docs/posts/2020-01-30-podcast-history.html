        <p>Here’s a highlight reel of my history with podcasts:</p>
<p>I first started listening to podcasts like <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/">Planet Money</a> and <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a> on my iPod when I was an exchange student in Koblenz, Germany for a year.</p>
<p>A few years later, I went through the entire back catalogue of <a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/">The Partially Examined Life</a> and <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/stuff-you-missed-in-history-cl-21124503/">Stuff You Missed In History Class</a> while driving across the country and trying to land my first job.</p>
<p>I took a break for a while after that but started again when two of my closest friends launched <a href="https://twitter.com/BFD_podcast">Breakfast For Dinner</a> together. That got me hooked again and I started listening to everything Gimlet Media put out.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> came out and podcasting blew up! It was a cool momement, but discoverability got a lot harder after that.</p>
<p>I spent a year and a half doing the long Bay Area commute once I moved to San Francisco and during that time I picked up <a href="http://acquired.fm/">Acquired</a> and more recently <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/">Software Engineering Daily</a>. Those are the two main podcasts I’m still listening to these days.</p>
