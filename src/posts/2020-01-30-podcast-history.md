Hi Supercasters, 

Thanks for dropping by! Here's a highlight reel of my history with podcasts:

I first started listening to podcasts like [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/) and [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/) on my iPod when I was an exchange student in Koblenz, Germany for a year.

A few years later, I went through the entire back catalogue of [The Partially Examined Life](https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/) and [Stuff You Missed In History Class](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/stuff-you-missed-in-history-cl-21124503/) while driving across the country and trying to land my first job.

I took a break for a while after that but started again when two of my closest friends launched [Breakfast For Dinner](https://twitter.com/BFD_podcast) together. That got me hooked again and I started listening to everything Gimlet Media put out.

Then [Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/) came out and podcasting blew up! It was a cool momement, but discoverability got a lot harder after that.

I spent a year and a half doing the long Bay Area commute once I moved to San Francisco and during that time I picked up [Acquired](http://acquired.fm/) and more recently [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/). Those are the two main podcasts I'm still listening to these days.
