### Journey :: Motivation -> Fun -> Profit -> Knowledge
Before I was paid to code, I improved GBDT and logistic regression models and worked on fraud-detection infrastructure and ETL for payments data at Facebook.

I had a lot of help from colleagues at Facebook and spent much of my time outside of work learning to code before moving onto the Community Operations Engineering team, working on building internal tools for Facebook's global workforce.

After 5 years at Facebook, I joined Atrium Legal Technology Services as Lead Software Engineer where I'm reasonably compensated for my machine-whispering abilities.
