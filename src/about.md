### 2019 Goals: Always looking ahead
Hop on the ML bandwagon via [Google's AI crash course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) and [Deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). I think speech recognition and voice interfaces are really interesting.

### Journey :: Motivation -> Fun -> Profit -> Knowledge
Before I was paid to code, I improved GBDT and logistic regression models and worked on fraud-detection infrastructure and ETL for payments data at Facebook.

I had a lot of help from colleagues at Facebook and spent much of my time outside of work learning to code before moving into my current job, where I'm reasonably compensated for my machine-whispering abilities.
